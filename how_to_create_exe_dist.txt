1. Create minimal environment to run the app in conda. E.g. 'conda create --name new_env'

2. Activate the environment 'conda activate new_env'

3. cd to this folder. Install packages from requirements.txt using 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 

NOTE: for ensuring that spaCy models are loaded into the program correctly in requirements.txt, follow this guide: https://spacy.io/usage/models#models-download

6. If necessary, create hook- files to tell pyinstaller to include specific packages in the exe build. Examples are provided for en_core_web_sm (a spaCy model). Put these in the build_deps\ subfolder

7. pip install pyinstaller

8. In command line, cd to the folder that contains app.py. 

9.Run the following, assuming you want to make one single .exe file (This helped me: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/8108):

a) In command line: pyi-makespec --additional-hooks-dir="build_deps" --add-data "tesseract/:tesseract/" --add-data "poppler/poppler-24.02.0/:poppler/poppler-24.02.0/" --collect-data=gradio_client  --collect-data=gradio  --hidden-import pyarrow.vendored.version --hidden-import pydicom.encoders  --name DocRagPrepApp_0.1 app.py 

# Add --onefile  to the above if you would like everything packaged as a single exe, although this will need to be extracted upon starting the app, slowing down initialisation time significantly.


b) Open the created spec file in Notepad. Add the following to the end of the Analysis section then save:

a = Analysis(
    ...
    module_collection_mode={
        'gradio': 'py',  # Collect gradio package as source .py files
    }
)

c) Back in command line, run this: pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm DocRagPrepApp_0.1.spec


9. A 'dist' folder will be created with the executable inside along with all dependencies('dist\<app_name>'). 

10. In 'dist\<app_name>' try double clicking on the .exe file. After a short delay, the command prompt should inform you about the IP address of the app that is now running. Copy the IP address. **Do not close this window!**

11. In an Internet browser, navigate to the indicated IP address. The app should now be running in your browser window.
